His brother is in a gang.\n\n\nMASON: 13, linebacker, wildly optimistic. He loves just being there.\n\nAs JV assistant coach, quarterback, president of robotics club, alter boy (every Sunday), general member of drama club (for the art credit), and all around Good Samaritan, it was no surprise that Jacob was chosen for this year\u2018s graduation pageant. Every year students hear the same watered down speech from every previous \u201cMost Christlike;\u201d but Jacob knew he\u2019d be different. Jacob believes he was chosen as Jesus' reincarnate. This is a mighty position to fill, and it\u2019ll take some convincing. Mainly from his fellow JV teammates as speakers in the ceremony, Mason and childhood best friend Peyton. They only have 25 minutes before the ceremony, and it is up to Jacob to teach his friends, and soon to be followers, his divine intervention, no matter what it takes.\n\nAudition Requirements:\n-Seeking college age performers\n-Submit a 1-2 minute comedic monolouge\n-Due by March 1st\n-Callbacks will be the following weekend\n-Rehearsals during April-May\n-Tech: May 17th-24th\n\nIMPORTANT: There is an opening dance number, but we are not seeking trained dancers!!!\n\n\nShowcase your inner middle school angst;)\nDURATION\n\nApr 11, 2026 - May 24, 2026\nHOW TO APPLY\nAPPLY ONLINE\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMl1utJ5i0_LM4DehKlusCGWR-DwKN_6V65nN9ty48aWb9Fg/viewform?usp=header"

A man who doesn\u2019t understand himself and maybe\ndoesn't even know there is a Self to understand. Growing up in a rarefied, privileged world has spun a cocoon of narcissism and self-indulgence around what is in fact a sensitive, highly intelligent, and kind man. Some part of him is dimly ready to be woken up.\n\n[SEBASTIAN AND AS CAST] Male-identifying. Courageous, smart, compassionate. These qualities make him strangely attractive to everyone he meets. Sensitive to the point of being over-sensitive. Spontaneous and impulsive. His youth has the gift of accepting with complacent goodwill any situation as it comes, sometimes with an intense in-the-moment Presence, and sometimes with an infant\u2019s lack of object-permanence.\n\n[ANTONIO AND AS CAST] Male-identifying. Astonishingly brave, a little swashbuckling even. Has seen (and been the cause of) some horrifying violence, which out of love for Sebastian he dilutes or romanticizes, but the memory of and the potential for bloodshed are both there still. Loyal, capable of deep and utter devotion. Hopeless and even shy in his love for Sebastian, which he knows is not. returned and yet still is unable to help himself.\n\n[MARIA AND AS CAST] Female-identifying. Intelligent, mischievous, merry, cheerful, always with a twinkle in the eye, and so she finds it very hard to endure Olivia\u2019s enforced period of mourning. But she really is trying her best to be good. Salty and earthy, utterly in command. Like Toby, her joy and fun can turn mean on a dime, and she won\u2019t lose a moment\u2019s sleep over it. You might be laughing uproariously at something she\u2019s just said only to suddenly realize the joke was on you.\n\n[SIR TOBY BELCH AND AS CAST] Male-identifying. Immensely funny, witty, ranging from slapstick to deadpan. Occasionally cunning. Not a Falstaff, there is less expansiveness, less philosophy, more rapaciousness. Boisterous irresistible good humor and silliness that can turn into mean drunk quickly and unexpectedly. Never blustering, his improvisation is always masterful and in control. There\u2019s a kind of desperateness in his insistent partying that partly comes from his addiction (like all addicts, he carries on long past the point of real pleasure) and partly is a kind of childish (but vital!) rebellion against Olivia\u2019s mourning.\n\n[MALVOLIO AND AS CAST] Any gender identity. Not a tyrannical gargoyle, not pinched and cruel, not joyless, not loveless. \u201cSad and civil\u201d, which implies seriousness and self-control, but also empathy, or the capacity to hold space for others. Rather humorless, and they take their job very, *very* seriously. Their self-seriousness and rigorous application of themself to their work makes others see in them uppishness and pomposity (not totally unjustified), making them an easy and credulous target for cruel jokes. But from Malvolio's point of view, they're just doing their job (and doing it well) and they can\u2019t understand why nobody else is doing theirs. Their aspiration for Olivia\u2019s love is not entirely predatory/ambitious.\n\n[FABIAN AND AS CAST] Any gender identity. An essentially un-serious person, laconic bordering on insolent, Tom Sawyer-ish in their desire to escape all work or responsibility. Very smart. Playing hooky is an art and being useless a philosophy. Their enjoyment of the sandbox/playground of life is infectious. If you\u2019re planning a party you\u2019d be like \u201cOh, know who would LOVE this? Fabian.\u201d Witnessing the consequences of their actions is jarring for them.\n\n[FESTE AND AS CAST] Any gender identity. Wise enough to play the fool. Something of the stray dog about them. Unashamed to sing for their supper but knows also how to keep some part of themself separate and unclaimed. Comfortable in any company because they are utterly at ease with being seen. Nothing to hide and nowhere to hide it anyway. Singing required.\n\n\nSALARY\n\n99 Seat Agreement $17.81 per hour\n\nUNION\n\nAEA"

Since then they have been endlessly adapted and taken on countless reimaginings by readers around the world. Now, Washington Park in Brooklyn takes up the role of the Hundred Acre Woods. The familiar characters are older and the Forest is under threat from the impacts of climate change and an encroaching pipeline project. We see Winnie the Pooh and friends co-existing in a somewhat neglected habitat, their \u2018retirement community\u2019. They lovingly bicker and exchange grievances about their situation.\n\n\nWe\u2019re looking for actors with strong musicianship. For this upcoming May 2026 production, we\u2019ve envisioned a site-specific show where actors play instruments in a jug band as they traipse around Old Stone House and Washington Park - transforming it into the 100 Acre Wood!\n\n\nSongs will be led by guitar, banjo, and piano, accompanied by instruments like washtub bass, washboard, jugs, spoons, buckets, and bottles. If you have another instrument you love playing (Concertina? Flute? Violin? Tuba?), we\u2019d love to find a way to incorporate it into the score.\n\nThe play explores themes of aging and disability. The reality of this production dictates that actors must be able to walk, as well as climb stairs. But we\u2019d love to build a cast that reflects Brooklyn\u2019s diversity of ages and abilities. If you have limited mobility or are differently abled, don\u2019t hesitate to apply - we will accommodate.\n\nThe project is in continual development and has a long life ahead of it as a touring production through NYC and beyond. We want to find a cast that is excited by the material both for its elements of literary nostalgia surrounding the original Winnie the Pooh books, and for their urgent passion to engage with the current environmental landscape.\n\nListed vocal types are flexible, and we\u2019re very willing to adjust music to fit the cast\u2019s vocal range.\n\n\nSEEKING\n\n\n\nBand Leader\nPlays piano, guitar, or banjo.

While juggling his diner job, a make-or-break workshop for his sci-fi musical, and the unraveling relationships with his girlfriend and best friend, Jonathan feels the pressure mounting from every direction. But when life delivers an emotional wake-up call, he discovers that the real ticking isn\u2019t about career deadlines\u2014it\u2019s about love, loss, and the fire that pushes an artist to create against all odds.\n\nSEEKING:\n\n\nJONATHAN: (Male, 25 - early 30s) Dynamic, charismatic leading man. Struggling East Village\ncomposer turning 30; smart and likeable, extremely passionate and determined; edgily ironic and irreverent and a little self-involved. Strong rock voice. Tenor.

Set in a tight-knit 1970s Irish Catholic community, the family\u2019s private conversation is overheard by the parish\u2019s most fearsome gossip, sending rumors flying and putting the O\u2019Sheas\u2019 reputation\u2014and their sanity\u2014on the line. As Linda tries to retell and reclaim the events of the day, with her family chiming in to correct her version of the story, the play becomes a joyful, chaotic celebration of family, faith, and the fine art of surviving small-town scandal.\n\nSEEKING:\n\nLINDA O\u2019SHEA: (Female, 19-years old) Linda is highly intelligent, caring, and curious. She alternates between thinking she knows everything and thinking she knows nothing. Responsible and rarely impetuous.\n\nJOSEPHINE \u2018JO\u2019 O\u2019SHEA: (Female, late 40s, early 50s) Jo juggles more plates than Cirque de\nSoleil. A great mom who defines multi-tasking.

His definition of a father is: Breadwinner and disciplinarian. Lousy listener. / FATHER LOVETTT is an old school, Catholic priest. Egotistical, imperious, and pampered. Unused to any kind of pushback from parishioners or anyone else for that matter. / There is a BETTY HECKENBACH in everyone's life. She's right up there with death and taxes\u2014only less fun. Even if the role is played by a man, it will be played absolutely straight\u2014no winking or flamboyance.

Rather than following a traditional plot with one main character, the show uses a cast of performers to trace the arc of Cash\u2019s journey\u2014from humble beginnings in the Arkansas cotton fields, through love, struggle, faith, rebellion, heartbreak, and redemption\u2014while capturing the grit, humor, and soul that defined him. Through iconic songs like \u201cI Walk the Line,\u201d \u201cFolsom Prison Blues,\u201d and \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d the musical becomes a vibrant portrait of resilience and the power of music to carry us through every season of life.\n\nSEEKING:\n\nTRENNA: (Female, 20s-40s) Trenna functions as the primary female voice of the ensemble\u2014warm, intuitive, and grounded. She often embodies the perspective of June Carter Cash, though not as a literal portrayal. Her presence brings emotional balance, humor, and vitality to the storytelling. She is capable of both tender vulnerability and playful charm, anchoring many of the show\u2019s emotional arcs. Vocal Range: Flexible alto to mezzo; strong lead and harmony skills. Instruments: Acoustic guitar (preferred), basic percussion.\n\nJASON: (Male, 20s-40s) Jason often carries central narrative threads tied to young Johnny Cash\u2019s spirit\u2014hopeful, yearning, searching. While not a direct impersonation, he channels youthful energy, earnest charm, and emotional clarity. He functions as one of the musical anchors of the ensemble and frequently leads transitions between thematic segments. Vocal Range: Tenor/baritone with strong lead capability. Instruments: Acoustic guitar, hand percussion, auxiliary percussion.\n\nEDDIE: (Male, 20s-40s) Eddie embodies the raw drive and rock-leaning edge of Johnny Cash\u2019s\ninfluence. He often brings intensity, swagger, and musical grit to the ensemble. A dynamic presence, he helps fuel the show\u2019s rhythmic engine and frequently leads the more energetic or heavily guitar-driven numbers. Vocal Range: Tenor/baritone with commanding lead voice. Instruments: Acoustic guitar, electric guitar, various percussion.\n\nDAVID: (Male, 20s-40s) David is the ensemble\u2019s multi-instrumental backbone, bringing texture, color, and authenticity to the musical landscape. He often embodies the show\u2019s rural, roots-driven heart. His character presence tends to be calm, warm, and subtly humorous\u2014someone who helps tie the ensemble together musically and emotionally. Vocal Range: Flexible tenor/baritone with strong harmonies. Instruments: Electric guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle.\n\nMARK: (Male, 20s-40s) Mark provides the musical foundation\u2014steady, grounded, resonant. He often embodies a storyteller or observer role, offering reflective warmth and a grounded presence within the ensemble. While not always the focal soloist, his contributions are essential to the show\u2019s structure and feel. Vocal Range: Baritone/bass-baritone; strong blend and occasional solo lines. Instruments: Bass (upright preferred; electric acceptable).\n\n\nSALARY\n\nIndependent Theatre Contract $480 weekly minimum - plus housing, travel\n\nUNION\n\nAEA"

Produced by OUT/PLAY.\n\nTo be performed under the Equity Showcase Code for this production. Both AEA and Non-Equity performers are encouraged to apply.\n\nActors will receive a $100 total stipend for rehearsals and performances.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES:\n\nCallbacks: Sunday, February 15\n\nTable Read and Rehearsals Begin: Sunday, February 22\n\nPerformances:\nFriday, April 3, 2026 at 7PM;\nSaturday, April 4 at 7PM;\nSunday, April 5 at 3PM;\nSunday, April 5 at 7PM (possible addition);\nFriday, April 10, 2026 at 7PM;\nSaturday, April 11 at 7PM;\nSunday, April 12 at 3PM;\nSunday, April 12 at 7PM (possible addition)\n\nCHARACTER BREAKDOWN:\n\nThe play begins in 2010 and runs backward until the final scene which takes place in 2000. So, the first scene of the play is the last chronologically (eg: in the first scene of the play, Evan is 29, and in the last scene, he is 20).\n\nPeter: (Man; mid 40s, to play age 48 and 38) Artistic director of a prominent American regional theatre. Overtly and unapologetically flamboyant. If you cut him, he would bleed glitter. At the end of the play, Peter is in a long-term relationship with Mark. At the start of the play, he is dating Evan.\n\nBritish Mark: (Man; mid/late 30s, to play age 38 and 31) A lawyer. Best friends with Collin, whom he met while at University in England (where\u2014it hopefully goes without saying\u2014he is from). British Mark is dependable without being a martyr, attractive without much trying, and kind without being nice. Incredibly charming and often impulsive. Actor will be in their underwear and in sexual situations with another actor.\n\nTam: (Woman, early/mid 30s, to play age 32 and 28) When we first see her, Tam is a 5th grade teacher at an inner-city \u201cat risk\u201d school. At the end of the play, she is an Art History professor at the same university where Mark teaches. She\u2019s an organizer, a do-er, a shaker, and she can drink you under the table.\n\nMark: (Man, early 40s/late 30s, to play age 40 and 38) The chairperson of a small university art department. Caustic, blunt, scathing, icy, but all in an extremely sexy way. Mark wears his militant sexuality on his sleeve, and he prides himself on being a radical sex-positive activist. We don\u2019t know this for a fact, but he\u2019s probably into leather. At the end of the play, Mark is in a long term relationship with Peter. Actor will be seen shirtless in a sheet, with some possible nudity.\n\nCollin: (Man, early 30s, to play age 31) A lawyer. Best friends with British Mark. Collin has recently lost 125 pounds and is celebrating his new-found slender self. He is the glue connecting each member of his little urban tribe.\n\nEvan Wilder: (Man, to play age 30 through 20) *ALREADY CAST*\nMichael: (Man, early/mid 30s, to play age 32 and 26) *ALREADY CAST*\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n\nOUT/PLAY is committed to diversity across race, ethnicity, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status.\nDirectors will be coordinating rehearsals according to actor availability, though availability on weekends is a plus.\nActors must be off-book for all shows.\nDirector and actors are responsible for promoting the show on social media and through mailing lists. As a non-profit organization, OUT/PLAY needs everyone's participation for success.\nAll company members will receive a $5 discount code for tickets.\n\nOUT/PLAY's 2025-2026 SEASON\n\nOCTOBER 2025: Caffe Cino One-Acts\nDECEMBER 2025: Uncommon Women, by Wendy Wasserstein\nFEBRUARY 2026: Love In a Plague: Scenes from AIDS Plays\nAPRIL 2026: The Homosexuals, by Philip Dawkins\nJUNE 2026: Summer Shorts New Play Festival\n\nOUT/PLAY'S MISSION STATEMENT: Empower Queer Theatre Artists to bring new life to Queer plays for contemporary audiences.

An adequate dancing ability and a passion for teaching simple steps is encouraged!\n\n\n\n\nMusica Diegetica: Calling all musicians to Musica Diagetica, the heartbeat of the faire.

Roles focus on improvisation and immersive theater directly with audience members.\n\n\n\n\nRobin Hood Scenario (Fight Cast): The Robin Hood Scenario cast tells the tale of Robin Hood coming into his own as a leader of a Merry Band of outlaws, who come to blows against the power hungry Sheriff and guards. *SAFD training recommended.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional opportunities available post casting:\n\n\n\n\nShakespeare in the Shire:\n\nShakespeare in the Shire (SitS) is a daily performance that features a rotating lineup of monologues, scenes, songs, and games all taken from or inspired by the works of William Shakespeare.

On the whole, we encourage exploration, play, and creativity to bring the works of the Bard to life!\n\n\n\n\nWithin the ensemble, there will be a dedicated small group of improvisers - The Rude Mechanicals - however, there will also be opportunity for large group games, so everyone has a chance to join the merriment. If you love Shakespeare or any part of his works, we\u2019d love to have you!\n\n\n\n\nRequirements: one of your submitted monologues must be Shakespeare\n\n\n\n\nPastoral Dance Show:\n\nThe Pastoral Show is a renaissance period inspired dance show that takes place on the chess board once per performance day! Historically, a pastoral dance is a choreographed performance that celebrates the beauty and wonder of nature and rural living. This cross cast show marries pastoral\u2019s historical thesis while providing a spectacular moment of entertainment for the esteemed guests who come through our gates.\n\nIf you are interested in auditioning for the Pastoral Show, please note interest in dancing and your dance level on the audition form when submitting.

A man who doesn\u2019t understand himself and maybe\ndoesn't even know there is a Self to understand. Growing up in a rarefied, privileged world has spun a cocoon of narcissism and self-indulgence around what is in fact a sensitive, highly intelligent, and kind man. Some part of him is dimly ready to be woken up.\n\n[SEBASTIAN AND AS CAST] Male-identifying. Courageous, smart, compassionate. These qualities make him strangely attractive to everyone he meets. Sensitive to the point of being over-sensitive. Spontaneous and impulsive. His youth has the gift of accepting with complacent goodwill any situation as it comes, sometimes with an intense in-the-moment Presence, and sometimes with an infant\u2019s lack of object-permanence.\n\n[ANTONIO AND AS CAST] Male-identifying. Astonishingly brave, a little swashbuckling even. Has seen (and been the cause of) some horrifying violence, which out of love for Sebastian he dilutes or romanticizes, but the memory of and the potential for bloodshed are both there still. Loyal, capable of deep and utter devotion. Hopeless and even shy in his love for Sebastian, which he knows is not. returned and yet still is unable to help himself.\n\n[MARIA AND AS CAST] Female-identifying. Intelligent, mischievous, merry, cheerful, always with a twinkle in the eye, and so she finds it very hard to endure Olivia\u2019s enforced period of mourning. But she really is trying her best to be good. Salty and earthy, utterly in command. Like Toby, her joy and fun can turn mean on a dime, and she won\u2019t lose a moment\u2019s sleep over it. You might be laughing uproariously at something she\u2019s just said only to suddenly realize the joke was on you.\n\n[SIR TOBY BELCH AND AS CAST] Male-identifying. Immensely funny, witty, ranging from slapstick to deadpan. Occasionally cunning. Not a Falstaff, there is less expansiveness, less philosophy, more rapaciousness. Boisterous irresistible good humor and silliness that can turn into mean drunk quickly and unexpectedly. Never blustering, his improvisation is always masterful and in control. There\u2019s a kind of desperateness in his insistent partying that partly comes from his addiction (like all addicts, he carries on long past the point of real pleasure) and partly is a kind of childish (but vital!) rebellion against Olivia\u2019s mourning.\n\n[MALVOLIO AND AS CAST] Any gender identity. Not a tyrannical gargoyle, not pinched and cruel, not joyless, not loveless. \u201cSad and civil\u201d, which implies seriousness and self-control, but also empathy, or the capacity to hold space for others. Rather humorless, and they take their job very, *very* seriously. Their self-seriousness and rigorous application of themself to their work makes others see in them uppishness and pomposity (not totally unjustified), making them an easy and credulous target for cruel jokes. But from Malvolio's point of view, they're just doing their job (and doing it well) and they can\u2019t understand why nobody else is doing theirs. Their aspiration for Olivia\u2019s love is not entirely predatory/ambitious.\n\n[FABIAN AND AS CAST] Any gender identity. An essentially un-serious person, laconic bordering on insolent, Tom Sawyer-ish in their desire to escape all work or responsibility. Very smart. Playing hooky is an art and being useless a philosophy. Their enjoyment of the sandbox/playground of life is infectious. If you\u2019re planning a party you\u2019d be like \u201cOh, know who would LOVE this? Fabian.\u201d Witnessing the consequences of their actions is jarring for them.\n\n[FESTE AND AS CAST] Any gender identity. Wise enough to play the fool. Something of the stray dog about them. Unashamed to sing for their supper but knows also how to keep some part of themself separate and unclaimed. Comfortable in any company because they are utterly at ease with being seen. Nothing to hide and nowhere to hide it anyway. Singing required.\n\n\nSALARY\n\n99 Seat Agreement $17.81 per hour\n\nUNION\n\nAEA"

If you play an instrument, please send us a video of you playing it.\nIn your email, please briefly introduce yourself.\nIf you have a role(s) you're particularly interested in, please say so.\n\nPERSONNEL:\nWill review submissions:\n\nDirector, Madeline Wall\nMusic Director, Lily White\nBook and Lyrics Writer, Sarah Safford\nComposer, Sean Ivy\n\nABOUT THIS PROJECT:\nEcoDisaster in the Hundred Acre Wood\n\nNew Musical\n\n100 years ago Winnie the Pooh and his friends were introduced in an English magazine. Since then they have been endlessly adapted and taken on countless reimaginings by readers around the world. Now, Washington Park in Brooklyn takes up the role of the Hundred Acre Woods. The familiar characters are older and the Forest is under threat from the impacts of climate change and an encroaching pipeline project. We see Winnie the Pooh and friends co-existing in a somewhat neglected habitat, their \u2018retirement community\u2019. They lovingly bicker and exchange grievances about their situation.\n\n\nWe\u2019re looking for actors with strong musicianship. For this upcoming May 2026 production, we\u2019ve envisioned a site-specific show where actors play instruments in a jug band as they traipse around Old Stone House and Washington Park - transforming it into the 100 Acre Wood!\n\n\nSongs will be led by guitar, banjo, and piano, accompanied by instruments like washtub bass, washboard, jugs, spoons, buckets, and bottles. If you have another instrument you love playing (Concertina? Flute? Violin? Tuba?), we\u2019d love to find a way to incorporate it into the score.\n\nThe play explores themes of aging and disability. The reality of this production dictates that actors must be able to walk, as well as climb stairs. But we\u2019d love to build a cast that reflects Brooklyn\u2019s diversity of ages and abilities. If you have limited mobility or are differently abled, don\u2019t hesitate to apply - we will accommodate.\n\nThe project is in continual development and has a long life ahead of it as a touring production through NYC and beyond. We want to find a cast that is excited by the material both for its elements of literary nostalgia surrounding the original Winnie the Pooh books, and for their urgent passion to engage with the current environmental landscape.\n\nListed vocal types are flexible, and we\u2019re very willing to adjust music to fit the cast\u2019s vocal range.\n\n\nSEEKING\n\n\n\nBand Leader\nPlays piano, guitar, or banjo.

Vocal Range (middle C is C4): Strong belt Ab3 to D5\n\nINCIDENT AT OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL HELP\nDirector: Ginna Hoben\nRehearsals begin: July 13, 2026\nPerformances: July 23, 2026 - August 9, 2026\n\nSYNOPSIS: Incident at Our Lady of Perpetual Help is a fast-paced, heartwarming comedic play that follows 19-year-old Linda O\u2019Shea as she narrates the hilariously disastrous day when her attempt to give her younger sister \u201cthe talk\u201d spirals completely out of control. Set in a tight-knit 1970s Irish Catholic community, the family\u2019s private conversation is overheard by the parish\u2019s most fearsome gossip, sending rumors flying and putting the O\u2019Sheas\u2019 reputation\u2014and their sanity\u2014on the line. As Linda tries to retell and reclaim the events of the day, with her family chiming in to correct her version of the story, the play becomes a joyful, chaotic celebration of family, faith, and the fine art of surviving small-town scandal.\n\nSEEKING:\n\nLINDA O\u2019SHEA: (Female, 19-years old) Linda is highly intelligent, caring, and curious. She alternates between thinking she knows everything and thinking she knows nothing. Responsible and rarely impetuous.\n\nJOSEPHINE \u2018JO\u2019 O\u2019SHEA: (Female, late 40s, early 50s) Jo juggles more plates than Cirque de\nSoleil. A great mom who defines multi-tasking. She's also a little more emotional and prone to\noutbursts than usual because, well\u2026you\u2019ll see.\n\nBECKY O\u2019SHEA: (Female, 13-years old) Becky is an unusual child. Bright and verbal. Full of energy and a crazy-huge imagination. She speaks quickly, not unlike some of the characters in the movies she loves, like \"His Girl Friday.\"\n\nTHERESA \u2018TERRI\u2019 CHARMICHAEL: (Female, late 50s) Terri is definitely going through a rough\npatch, but she is not a depressive or phlegmatic. Think Thelma Ritter or Eve Arden, with a touch of Dorothy Parker. Fast talker.\n\nTRACK 1: (Male, 50s) This track will double as three roles - Mike O\u2019Shea (50s)/ Father Lovett (50s)/ Betty Heckenbach (50s): MIKE is loud, loyal, and single-task oriented. His definition of a father is: Breadwinner and disciplinarian. Lousy listener. / FATHER LOVETTT is an old school, Catholic priest. Egotistical, imperious, and pampered. Unused to any kind of pushback from parishioners or anyone else for that matter. / There is a BETTY HECKENBACH in everyone's life. She's right up there with death and taxes\u2014only less fun. Even if the role is played by a man, it will be played absolutely straight\u2014no winking or flamboyance. Just a homely, judgmental, middle-aged woman sticking her big puss into other people's business.\n\nRING OF FIRE\nDirector: Michael Santora\nMusic Director: TBD\nRehearsals begin: August 10, 2026\nPerformances: August 20, 2026 - September 6, 2026\n\nSYNOPSIS: Ring of Fire is a spirited, toe-tapping musical that celebrates the life, legacy, and music of Johnny Cash by threading together his greatest hits to tell a sweeping American story. Rather than following a traditional plot with one main character, the show uses a cast of performers to trace the arc of Cash\u2019s journey\u2014from humble beginnings in the Arkansas cotton fields, through love, struggle, faith, rebellion, heartbreak, and redemption\u2014while capturing the grit, humor, and soul that defined him. Through iconic songs like \u201cI Walk the Line,\u201d \u201cFolsom Prison Blues,\u201d and \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d the musical becomes a vibrant portrait of resilience and the power of music to carry us through every season of life.\n\nSEEKING:\n\nTRENNA: (Female, 20s-40s) Trenna functions as the primary female voice of the ensemble\u2014warm, intuitive, and grounded. She often embodies the perspective of June Carter Cash, though not as a literal portrayal. Her presence brings emotional balance, humor, and vitality to the storytelling. She is capable of both tender vulnerability and playful charm, anchoring many of the show\u2019s emotional arcs. Vocal Range: Flexible alto to mezzo; strong lead and harmony skills. Instruments: Acoustic guitar (preferred), basic percussion.\n\nJASON: (Male, 20s-40s) Jason often carries central narrative threads tied to young Johnny Cash\u2019s spirit\u2014hopeful, yearning, searching. While not a direct impersonation, he channels youthful energy, earnest charm, and emotional clarity. He functions as one of the musical anchors of the ensemble and frequently leads transitions between thematic segments. Vocal Range: Tenor/baritone with strong lead capability. Instruments: Acoustic guitar, hand percussion, auxiliary percussion.\n\nEDDIE: (Male, 20s-40s) Eddie embodies the raw drive and rock-leaning edge of Johnny Cash\u2019s\ninfluence. He often brings intensity, swagger, and musical grit to the ensemble. A dynamic presence, he helps fuel the show\u2019s rhythmic engine and frequently leads the more energetic or heavily guitar-driven numbers. Vocal Range: Tenor/baritone with commanding lead voice. Instruments: Acoustic guitar, electric guitar, various percussion.\n\nDAVID: (Male, 20s-40s) David is the ensemble\u2019s multi-instrumental backbone, bringing texture, color, and authenticity to the musical landscape. He often embodies the show\u2019s rural, roots-driven heart. His character presence tends to be calm, warm, and subtly humorous\u2014someone who helps tie the ensemble together musically and emotionally. Vocal Range: Flexible tenor/baritone with strong harmonies. Instruments: Electric guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle.\n\nMARK: (Male, 20s-40s) Mark provides the musical foundation\u2014steady, grounded, resonant.

While not always the focal soloist, his contributions are essential to the show\u2019s structure and feel. Vocal Range: Baritone/bass-baritone; strong blend and occasional solo lines. Instruments: Bass (upright preferred; electric acceptable).\n\n\nSALARY\n\nIndependent Theatre Contract $480 weekly minimum - plus housing, travel\n\nUNION\n\nAEA"

Produced by OUT/PLAY.\n\nTo be performed under the Equity Showcase Code for this production. Both AEA and Non-Equity performers are encouraged to apply.\n\nActors will receive a $100 total stipend for rehearsals and performances.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES:\n\nCallbacks: Sunday, February 15\n\nTable Read and Rehearsals Begin: Sunday, February 22\n\nPerformances:\nFriday, April 3, 2026 at 7PM;\nSaturday, April 4 at 7PM;\nSunday, April 5 at 3PM;\nSunday, April 5 at 7PM (possible addition);\nFriday, April 10, 2026 at 7PM;\nSaturday, April 11 at 7PM;\nSunday, April 12 at 3PM;\nSunday, April 12 at 7PM (possible addition)\n\nCHARACTER BREAKDOWN:\n\nThe play begins in 2010 and runs backward until the final scene which takes place in 2000. So, the first scene of the play is the last chronologically (eg: in the first scene of the play, Evan is 29, and in the last scene, he is 20).\n\nPeter: (Man; mid 40s, to play age 48 and 38) Artistic director of a prominent American regional theatre. Overtly and unapologetically flamboyant. If you cut him, he would bleed glitter. At the end of the play, Peter is in a long-term relationship with Mark. At the start of the play, he is dating Evan.\n\nBritish Mark: (Man; mid/late 30s, to play age 38 and 31) A lawyer. Best friends with Collin, whom he met while at University in England (where\u2014it hopefully goes without saying\u2014he is from). British Mark is dependable without being a martyr, attractive without much trying, and kind without being nice. Incredibly charming and often impulsive. Actor will be in their underwear and in sexual situations with another actor.\n\nTam: (Woman, early/mid 30s, to play age 32 and 28) When we first see her, Tam is a 5th grade teacher at an inner-city \u201cat risk\u201d school. At the end of the play, she is an Art History professor at the same university where Mark teaches. She\u2019s an organizer, a do-er, a shaker, and she can drink you under the table.\n\nMark: (Man, early 40s/late 30s, to play age 40 and 38) The chairperson of a small university art department. Caustic, blunt, scathing, icy, but all in an extremely sexy way. Mark wears his militant sexuality on his sleeve, and he prides himself on being a radical sex-positive activist. We don\u2019t know this for a fact, but he\u2019s probably into leather. At the end of the play, Mark is in a long term relationship with Peter. Actor will be seen shirtless in a sheet, with some possible nudity.\n\nCollin: (Man, early 30s, to play age 31) A lawyer. Best friends with British Mark. Collin has recently lost 125 pounds and is celebrating his new-found slender self. He is the glue connecting each member of his little urban tribe.\n\nEvan Wilder: (Man, to play age 30 through 20) *ALREADY CAST*\nMichael: (Man, early/mid 30s, to play age 32 and 26) *ALREADY CAST*\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n\nOUT/PLAY is committed to diversity across race, ethnicity, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status.\nDirectors will be coordinating rehearsals according to actor availability, though availability on weekends is a plus.\nActors must be off-book for all shows.\nDirector and actors are responsible for promoting the show on social media and through mailing lists. As a non-profit organization, OUT/PLAY needs everyone's participation for success.\nAll company members will receive a $5 discount code for tickets.\n\nOUT/PLAY's 2025-2026 SEASON\n\nOCTOBER 2025: Caffe Cino One-Acts\nDECEMBER 2025: Uncommon Women, by Wendy Wasserstein\nFEBRUARY 2026: Love In a Plague: Scenes from AIDS Plays\nAPRIL 2026: The Homosexuals, by Philip Dawkins\nJUNE 2026: Summer Shorts New Play Festival\n\nOUT/PLAY'S MISSION STATEMENT: Empower Queer Theatre Artists to bring new life to Queer plays for contemporary audiences.

Roles focus on guest immersion and children centric entertainment while assisting with the overall production.\n\n\n\n\nFae (Movement Cast): These fantastikal, magical, and somewhat mischievous creatures combine elements of mime, ASL, and movement to bring whimsy, wonder, and a bit of mayhem to the shire for adults and children alike. Roles are focused on movement, and child-friendly entertainment and storytelling.\n\n\n\n\n*Additional audition material required, see above*\n\n\n\n\nGolden Boarstags: The Golden Boarstags, a renown mercenary company, is a cast based around hosting and monitoring the Pub Crawl, a stand alone experience at the New York Renaissance Faire. Additionally, the Golden Boarstags creates and performs a comedic variety show at the end of the day. Throughout the day there is much opportunity to flex your acting chops as we employ ample improv comedy, musical talent and general (but controlled) mischief. This cast does require the ability to walk for long periods, a willingness to engage with guests who are consuming alcohol, and the enthusiasm to create and workshop entertainment with fellow castmates.\n\n\n\n\n*Servsafe certification will be required and training provided for employment.*\n\n\n\n\nGuild of St. George (Includes Fight Roles): Within the greater Performance Company, The Guild of Saint George ensemble provides a theatrical portrayal of the working court of Queen Elizabeth I on royal progress. GoSG achieves the primary goal of inclusion and elevation by welcoming guests into a little slice of Elizabethan courtly life, greeting patrons as fellow esteemed nobility, with pageantry and personability. The Guild of St. George focuses on historical fantasy, ensemble work, stylized movement for the purpose of storytelling, or even sitting one-on-one with guests in a moment of connection across time.\n\n\n\n\n*Including one heightened language monologue would be encouraged for those interested in auditioning for the Guide of St. George cast.*\n\n\n\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Blades (Guild of St. George): The Queen\u2019s Blades is a sparring tournament that takes place in the Guild of Saint George for Her Majesty\u2019s entertainment. Six sword fighters, armed with a variety of weapons, will duel in pairs to the disarm or yield, showcasing their skills and competing for the Queen\u2019s favor. All the while, the rest of the Court and the audience propose wagers and cheer for their champions! This show is for those interested in historical martial arts, witty banter and (mostly) friendly competition, and exploring stage combat in a smaller, more intimate setting within the larger scheme of our performance day.\n\n\n\n\n*A Stage Combat Video Submission and attendance at the Fight Call on Saturday March 28th is required to participate. Armed Stage Combat Training is preferred*\n\n\n\n\nThe Heralds: The Heralds are a group of nautically-themed performers who bring joy and music to our guests while providing immersive crowd management. There are opportunities to perform at several events during the day, including \"Hark the Heralds!\" (a singing stage show full of sea shanties), a Pirate Maypole, and hosts various themed balls throughout the season. The Heralds are looking for talented improv performers, actor-singer-musicians, and folks interested in in-character patron management and communication. An adequate dancing ability and a passion for teaching simple steps is encouraged!\n\n\n\n\nMusica Diegetica: Calling all musicians to Musica Diagetica, the heartbeat of the faire. This cast provides the musical soundtrack for the biggest events, including the jousts, chess matches, court dances and maypoles. There are additional opportunities to shine in independent band sets and intimate character interactions. We are looking for intermediate to advanced players with an ability to read music or learn by ear quickly and accurately. All instruments are welcome but we are particularly looking for trumpet, trombone, percussion, violin, viola, and various woodwinds (Electronic instruments need not apply).\n\n\n\n\nRevelers: These rowdy rambunctious rockstars sing songs, dance maypoles, and interact with the audience, creating the thrumming life of shire. Roles focus on improvisation and immersive theater directly with audience members.\n\n\n\n\nRobin Hood Scenario (Fight Cast): The Robin Hood Scenario cast tells the tale of Robin Hood coming into his own as a leader of a Merry Band of outlaws, who come to blows against the power hungry Sheriff and guards. *SAFD training recommended.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional opportunities available post casting:\n\n\n\n\nShakespeare in the Shire:\n\nShakespeare in the Shire (SitS) is a daily performance that features a rotating lineup of monologues, scenes, songs, and games all taken from or inspired by the works of William Shakespeare. It is an extracurricular of sorts, requiring one extra hour of time at the end of Saturday rehearsal days, with opportunities for director and peer feedback. On the whole, we encourage exploration, play, and creativity to bring the works of the Bard to life!\n\n\n\n\nWithin the ensemble, there will be a dedicated small group of improvisers - The Rude Mechanicals - however, there will also be opportunity for large group games, so everyone has a chance to join the merriment. If you love Shakespeare or any part of his works, we\u2019d love to have you!\n\n\n\n\nRequirements: one of your submitted monologues must be Shakespeare\n\n\n\n\nPastoral Dance Show:\n\nThe Pastoral Show is a renaissance period inspired dance show that takes place on the chess board once per performance day! Historically, a pastoral dance is a choreographed performance that celebrates the beauty and wonder of nature and rural living. This cross cast show marries pastoral\u2019s historical thesis while providing a spectacular moment of entertainment for the esteemed guests who come through our gates.\n\nIf you are interested in auditioning for the Pastoral Show, please note interest in dancing and your dance level on the audition form when submitting. You can also ask to speak with the Dance Director at auditions. Please note that the dance call to audition for Pastoral will take place on the first \u201call company\u201d rehearsal day post casting finalizations and contract acceptance.\nDURATION\n\nJun 13, 2026 - Oct 4, 2026\n\nSALARY\n\n$64.00 \u2013 $120.00 per day\nHOW TO APPLY\nAPPLY ONLINE\n\nhttps://renfair.com/ny/join-us/"
