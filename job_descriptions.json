The Scenic Projection Designer would join production meetings before the start of the rehearsal schedule for planning and initial design discussions, and be available for some portion of the rehearsal schedule to adapt and refine designs given the developmental nature of this new work. This new musical blends athleticism, humor, and heart, and we\u2019re looking for a designer who can help build a dynamic visual world through projection including scenes on the island of Crete in Greece and athletic fields in different locations where the sport of ultimate frisbee will come to life."

        "description": "From the people behind \u201cGarfeld: The Musical (A Garfield Parody),\u201d comes a brand-new, unhinged parody musical. Randy McDandy, the beloved clown mascot behind fast food chain McDandys, bites off more than he can chew when he attempts to manage one of his restaurants in the dangerous Slumsville. He\u2019s shocked to discover that his restaurant once bursting with color and fun has been turned into a cold, corporate environment with no trace of the charm it once had. Randy vows to return McDandys back to its former glory, battling the capitalist heads up in corporate, as well as the cynicism of a modern world that sees clowns as scary. Along the way, we meet other colorful friends and foes, including the evil villain Robber-Burger and his sidekick Dandy Boy, Pingas (the big purple narrator, a la Grimace), Amber & Donovere (the mopey teens working at McDandys), Fran (the unlucky manager of the Slumsville McDandys, and a love interest for Randy), and many more! It's a ridiculous parody served with a side of earnestness and heart."

        "description": "From the people behind \u201cGarfeld: The Musical (A Garfield Parody),\u201d comes a brand-new, unhinged parody musical. Randy McDandy, the beloved clown mascot behind fast food chain McDandys, bites off more than he can chew when he attempts to manage one of his restaurants in the dangerous Slumsville. He\u2019s shocked to discover that his restaurant once bursting with color and fun has been turned into a cold, corporate environment with no trace of the charm it once had. Randy vows to return McDandys back to its former glory, battling the capitalist heads up in corporate, as well as the cynicism of a modern world that sees clowns as scary. Along the way, we meet other colorful friends and foes, including the evil villain Robber-Burger and his sidekick Dandy Boy, Pingas (the big purple narrator, a la Grimace), Amber & Donovere (the mopey teens working at McDandys), Fran (the unlucky manager of the Slumsville McDandys, and a love interest for Randy), and many more! It's a ridiculous parody served with a side of earnestness and heart."
