The Scenic Projection Designer would join production meetings before the start of the rehearsal schedule for planning and initial design discussions, and be available for some portion of the rehearsal schedule to adapt and refine designs given the developmental nature of this new work. This new musical blends athleticism, humor, and heart, and we\u2019re looking for a designer who can help build a dynamic visual world through projection including scenes on the island of Crete in Greece and athletic fields in different locations where the sport of ultimate frisbee will come to life."
